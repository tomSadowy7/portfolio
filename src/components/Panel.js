      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a junior at Princeton University majoring in Computer Science on the engineering track, with minors in Robotics
        & Applied Mathematics. At Princeton, I lead software teams at the Princeton Robotics Club (Pacbot subteam) and 
        at Princeton Autonomous Vehicles Engineering. I'm deepy interested in large-scale distributed systems, machine learning, computer vision, and autonomous
        robotics. In my free time, I love to explore nature, go on runs, and play the piano.
